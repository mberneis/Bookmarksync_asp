            <br><h2>Partner with SyncIT.com</h2>
              <h4>Become a co-branded partner with SyncIT.com and increase stickiness 
                to your site.</h4>
              <p>Attract new visitors and give them another reason to stay by 
                adding SyncIT's bookmark management services to your site. When 
                you become SyncIT's co-branded partner, visitors of your site 
                will be able to view and access their bookmarks and favorites 
                directly from your site. Daily traffic to your site will increase 
                with SyncIT's added features, since users need their bookmarks 
                every time they log onto the web. </p>
              <p>Partnering with SyncIT also gives your site a great marketing 
                tool to promote your various products and services. All of SyncIT's 
                partners receive a banner on the pop-up menu which is attached 
                to the SyncIT client. The banner provides links to the features 
                or pages on your site which you would like to promote.  You can 
                use the banner to push the most recent and relevant information 
                to your users without update e-mails which hardly ever get read. 
                In addition, SyncIT will increase your brand visibility by promoting 
                your banner and links to our valued community of internet-savvy 
                users. </p>
              <h4>Reasons to choose SyncIT.com.</h4>
              <p>SyncIT has received numerous awards and rave reviews as the #1 
                rated bookmark utility on the internet. We invite you to read 
                some of our <a href="press.asp">press clippings</a>, but <a href="/download/">download the software</a> and see 
                for yourself how SyncIT can work for you. </p>
              <p>SyncIT is better than other bookmark managers because we have 
                exclusive technology that synchronizes your bookmarks and favorites 
                across different computers, operating systems and browsers, without 
                changing the way you save or delete your bookmarks. SyncIT users 
                do not have to download bulky toolbars or surfboards, import bookmarks 
                manually, nor do they need to log into our website every time they want
                to update their bookmarks.  SyncIT operates unobtrusively from a small
                toolbar button that sits on every user's desktop, which has the power 
                to transmit a large quantity of the latest information to targeted 
                audiences. </p>
              <p>Partnering with SyncIT.com is a hassle-free experience. We provide 
                full service, from building the co-branded pages and providing 
                technical support to updating your banner links.  We provide all 
                of our services for free because we are dedicated in providing 
                the internet community with the most functional, free software, 
                and we merely want to get the word out to users who have not yet 
                heard of SyncIT. </p>
            <h4>Tangible Results from partnering with SyncIT.</h4>

                garnered from the co-branded page. Furthermore, we will promote
